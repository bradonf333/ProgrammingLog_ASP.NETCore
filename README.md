# Programming Log Application

## About
This is an app using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Angular.

## Purpose
I wanted to create this app for 2 reasons:
1. I wanted a way to track how much time I had spent programming.
    * This included actual time programming or any time spent to learning programming.
    Whether this was reading books, watching tutorials and following along, or building my own applications from scratch, anything like that.
2. This app serves as a programming diary. I can enter what I worked on that day, what worked, what didn't. I can note the progress I made or the troubles I had.
I can go back to any point in time and look to see what I worked on that day.
