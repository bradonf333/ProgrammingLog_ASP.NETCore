# Programming Log Application

## Description
This is an app using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Angular.

## Purpose
I wanted to create this app for 2 reasons:
1. I wanted a way to track how much time I had spent programming.
    * This included actual time programming or any time spent to learning programming.
    Whether this was reading books, watching tutorials and following, anything like that.
2. This app serves as a programming diary also. I can enter what I worked on that day, what worked, what didn't.
